Food Waste in Europe;Around 88 million tons of food are wasted annually in the EU, costing approximately €143 billion. Reducing food waste is seen as critical for both climate action and food security.;;;
Water Stress in Europe;According to the European Environment Agency (EEA), southern Europe faces severe water stress, with some regions already experiencing drought-like conditions due to climate change.;;;
Deforestation in the Amazon;While not European-specific, global deforestation impacts Europe through biodiversity loss and increased CO2 emissions. Approximately 10% of Europe’s imported agricultural goods contribute to deforestation abroad.;;;
Microplastics in the Arctic;A 2022 study found microplastic particles in Arctic ice and snow, highlighting the global scale of plastic pollution, which affects even the most remote regions.;;;
