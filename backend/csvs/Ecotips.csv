Carpool & Connect;Carpooling is an easy way to reduce your emissions and it’s a fun way to get to know your neighbours.;;;;
Green Camping Essentials;Try to purchase environmentally friendly bug sprays and sunscreen, and be sure to recycle your fuel canisters after a weekend of camping.;;;;
Vote for the Planet;Environmental change starts at the individual, but if you want to support big changes in environmental policy and conservation, be sure to do so by voting for candidates that align with your environmental causes, voicing your concerns to your elected officials on certain issues, and supporting conservation organizations either financially or by volunteering.;;;;
Leave No Trace (and Beyond);Practice Leave No Trace, maybe even taking it a step further by picking up and disposing of any trash you find on your journey outdoors.;;;;
Shop Local, Eat Fresh;It’s important to consider where your food comes from. The food you purchase in grocery stores can travel hundreds if not thousands of miles before it reaches your home. By shopping local—either at farm stands, farmer’s markets, or a community supported agriculture (CSA) program— you’re helping to lower carbon emissions from transporting those foods, as well as from non-sustainable agricultural practices, and lessen your own carbon footprint.;;;;
Upcycle Your Way to Zero Waste;Upcycling, or creating new uses for otherwise unwanted products, is a fun and easy way to reduce your waste. Before tossing, say, your plastic strawberry container from the grocery store, consider other ways to use the product: fill it with soil and plant seeds or use it to separate items in your desk drawers.;;;;
T-Shirts to Towels;Have some old T-shirts that even thrift stores don’t want? Cut them up into dish rags to use instead of buying paper towels.;;;;
Shop Smart, Waste Less;To help reduce food waste as an individual, first try to limit shopping for only what you need.;;;;
Compost Like a Pro;Composting is another effective way to reduce food waste—instead of tossing out your food scraps, build your own compost bin, drop off at a designated collection site, or participate in your city or town’s program (if available).;;;;
Reusable Heroes;Invest in reusable products like water bottles, coffee mugs, beeswax food wraps, canvas shopping bags, and sustainable eating utensils, which help reduce plastic use and saves you money in the long term.;;;;
Switch to LED Bulbs;Replace traditional incandescent light bulbs with energy-efficient LED bulbs. LEDs use significantly less energy, last much longer, and can save you money on your electricity bill while reducing energy consumption.;;;;
Unplug Devices;Many devices continue to draw power even when turned off. Unplug chargers, appliances, and electronics when not in use to save energy and reduce your carbon footprint. Consider using a power strip to make switching off multiple devices easier.;;;;
Collect Rainwater;Install a rain barrel to collect rainwater from your gutters. This water can be reused for watering plants, washing your car, or cleaning outdoor areas, reducing your reliance on treated tap water and saving resources.;;;;
Plant Native Plants;Native plants are adapted to your local environment and require less water, fertilizers, and pesticides. They also support pollinators like bees and butterflies, helping to maintain biodiversity and a healthy ecosystem.;;;;
Dry Clothes Naturally;Instead of using an energy-intensive dryer, hang your clothes to dry on a clothesline or drying rack. Not only does this save electricity, but it also helps your clothes last longer by reducing wear and tear.;;;;
Choose Second-Hand Items;Shopping second-hand reduces waste and the demand for new products, which often require energy-intensive manufacturing. Visit thrift stores or browse online marketplaces to find unique, affordable, and eco-friendly items.;;;;
Avoid Single-Use Plastics;Single-use plastics, like water bottles, utensils, and packaging, contribute to pollution and take centuries to decompose. Replace them with reusable alternatives such as stainless steel straws, bamboo utensils, and silicone food bags.;;;;
Use Eco-Friendly Cleaning Products;Many conventional cleaning products contain harmful chemicals. Switch to biodegradable and non-toxic alternatives, or make your own using simple ingredients like vinegar, baking soda, and lemon juice to keep your home clean and green.;;;;
Borrow or Rent Tools;nstead of buying tools or equipment you’ll only use occasionally, borrow from friends or rent them from tool libraries or hardware stores. This reduces waste, saves space, and promotes sharing within your community.;;;;
Repair, Don’t Replace;Before throwing away broken items, consider repairing them. Many household items, like clothing, electronics, and furniture, can be fixed with simple tools or by visiting repair cafes, saving you money and reducing landfill waste.;;;;
Eat More Plant-Based Meals;Incorporate more plant-based meals into your diet to reduce your carbon footprint. Producing meat requires large amounts of water, land, and energy. Even one meatless day a week, like Meatless Mondays, can make a big difference.;;;;
Grow Your Own Herbs or Veggies;Start a small garden at home, even if it’s just a few pots on your windowsill. Growing your own food reduces packaging waste, transportation emissions, and reliance on store-bought produce while giving you fresher, healthier options.;;;;
Recycle Electronics Properly;Old electronics contain harmful materials and should never be tossed in the trash. Find a local e-waste recycling program to ensure these items are disposed of safely and their valuable components are reused.;;;;
Take Shorter Showers;Cutting your shower time by just a few minutes can save plenty of water. Install a low-flow showerhead for even more savings. Conserving water helps protect natural resources and reduces energy used for water heating.;;;;
Carry a Reusable Straw;Small actions add up! Keep a reusable straw in your bag or car so you’re always prepared. Reusable straws made from stainless steel, bamboo, or silicone help reduce the billions of plastic straws that end up in the ocean every year.;;;;
Ditch Wrapping Paper;Traditional wrapping paper is often non-recyclable. Instead, use reusable fabric wraps, old newspapers, or decorative gift bags that can be reused multiple times. This small swap can reduce holiday and event-related waste.;;;;
Opt for Digital Receipts;Ask stores to email your receipts instead of printing paper copies. This helps cut down on paper waste and makes it easier to organize your records digitally without losing receipts.;;;;
Choose Public Transport;Whenever possible, take buses, trains, or carpool instead of driving alone. Public transportation reduces the number of vehicles on the road, lowering emissions and traffic congestion. Biking or walking is even better for your health and the planet.;;;;
Go Paperless;Reduce paper use by switching to digital billing, online banking, and electronic note-taking apps. Many companies offer discounts for going paperless, and you’ll also save trees and reduce clutter at home.;;;;
Reduce Junk Mail;Minimize unwanted mail by unsubscribing from catalogs and opting out of marketing lists. Sign up for services that remove your address from junk mail databases and encourage companies to switch to digital marketing options.;;;;
