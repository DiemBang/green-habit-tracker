Reuse water for plants;Why not use otherwise wasted water to nurture your houseplants?;Reusing water reduces the energy used in water treatment, although the savings are relatively small.;;;Home,Work
Reuse coffee grounds as fertilizer;Instead of throwing away used coffee grounds, spread them in your garden to enrich soil and help plants thrive.;Coffee grounds are typically discarded, contributing to landfill waste. Reusing them reduces waste and the need for synthetic fertilizers, which have a high carbon footprint.;0.001;100;Home,Work
Resuse printed paper;Repurpose paper that has been printed on one side for notes, sketches, or printing again to cut down on waste.;Recycling and reusing paper saves energy used in producing new paper and reduces deforestation.;0.007;100;Home,Work
BYO containers to the bulk store;Bring your own reusable containers to bulk stores to minimize packaging waste and reduce your environmental footprint.;By avoiding packaged goods, you cut down on plastic production and reduce packaging waste, leading to significant energy savings.;0.182;100;On-the-go
Turn kitchen scraps into compost;Instead of tossing food scraps, compost them to create nutrient-rich soil for gardens and reduce landfill waste.;Composting prevents food waste from entering landfills, where it would release methane, a potent greenhouse gas.;0.927;100;Home,Work
Recycle old appliances;Dispose of outdated or broken appliances responsibly by recycling them to recover valuable materials and reduce e-waste.;Recycling appliances recovers valuable materials (like metals) and reduces the need for new raw materials, thus saving emissions associated with production.;1.440;150;Home,Work
Donate unneeded clothing;Instead of discarding old clothes, donate them to charities or second-hand stores to extend their life and help others.;Donating clothes extends their life cycle, reducing the need for new garments and the energy spent on manufacturing, transportation, and disposal.;4.200;150;Home
